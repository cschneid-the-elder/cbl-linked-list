# cbl-linked-list
linked list demonstration in cobol

I had originally intended to contribute this code to the [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) site, however their licensing as of 29-Oct-2021 is the [GFDL version 1.2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/fdl-1.2.html) which, to my untrained eye, does not include a liability disclaimer.  There is [some discussion](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code_talk:Copyrights) of licensing issues which seems to have ended in 2014 without resolution.

So.  Here is what would have been my contribution to the doubly linked list [definition](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Doubly-linked_list/Definition), et. al. pages.
